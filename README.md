# Planet-Advertisement-Project

This project is based on the 20% Project, an initiative used by companies to allow employees to pursue personal projects during their paid work time.

The goal of this project was to learn a new skill, in which I chose to learn basic coding with the HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript languages.

The code contained in this repository documents my progress as I learned basic coding. The main project deliverable is a playable Tic-Tac-Toe game coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
